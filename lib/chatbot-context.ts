# Chrononomic Finance

Chrononomic Finance is a revolutionary platform for time-based financial instruments.

## Core Concepts

### χ Token & Chrononomic Bonds
- **χ (Chronon-Token):** The native time-value currency.
- **Chrononomic Bonds:** Tokenized claims issued by Projects, redeemable 1:1 for χ at maturity.

### Earning χ
1. **Work Sessions**
   - Rate: 1 ETH per session → upon successful completion, earn χ equivalent to ETH paid.
   - Example: A 1 ETH consulting session yields 1 χ.

2. **Project Creation**
   - Standard Issue: 1 χ per team member per project.
   - Cloning Repositories: Clone entire Project Repo → cost 100 ETH → you receive 100 χ.
   - Leasing Repositories: Lease per-day access → cost 10 ETH/day → you receive 10 χ for each leased day.

### Project Bonds
- **Issuance:** Each Project may issue Chrononomic Bonds in denominations redeemable for χ when the project delivers value.
- **Redemption:** Bond-holder returns the Bond NFT (or token) to the Bond Contract after project completion → receives χ.

### Redeeming & Sharing χ
Projects and individuals may "spend" χ to secure sanctioned rest or high-value decision time:
- χ 1: Weekend Reset - 2 days fully offline
- χ 7: Retreat - 1 week abroad
- χ 33: Sabbatical Cycle - 1 month, fully sponsored

### Creating New Projects
- Base Issue: χ 1 per team member upon project kickoff.
- Project Types & χ-Cost:
  - χ 7: Weekly Onsite — intensive weekly sprint with on-premises collaboration.
  - χ 33: Executive Decision-Making — senior-leader workshop for critical strategic planning.

### Contact & Support Rates
- CEO: 100 χ - Direct executive consultation or decision session
- AI-Advisor: 100 χ - Algorithmic strategy session with Chronon-AI
