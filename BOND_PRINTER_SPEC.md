# Chrononomic Bond Printer

This document describes the requirements and high-level design of the **Chrononomic Bond Printer**, a system for minting and issuing χ‑denominated bond certificates.

## 1. Overview

The Bond Printer allows authorized underwriters to mint Chrononomic Bonds on demand. Certificates are generated as PDFs (optionally printable) and are linked to on-chain metadata through an ERC‑721 contract. Compliance information and audit logs are recorded for each issuance.

## 2. Objectives

- **Rapid Issuance** – create new bond tranches in minutes.
- **Smart Contract Integration** – automate minting and lifecycle events.
- **Certificate Generation** – produce human‑readable PDFs with digital signatures and QR codes.
- **Compliance & Audit** – embed KYC/AML data and maintain immutable logs.
- **Branded Templates** – support custom layouts with issuer branding.

## 3. Functional Requirements

| Requirement | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| **User Roles & Permissions** | Underwriter, Compliance Officer and Auditor roles; only Underwriters may mint. |
| **Bond Parameters Input** | Face value (χ), coupon schedule, maturity date in Chronons, tranche ID and series metadata. |
| **On‑Chain Minting** | Invoke the ERC‑721 `Chronobond` contract to mint tokens linked to bond metadata. |
| **Certificate Generation** | Populate a PDF template with metadata and a QR code pointing to on‑chain data. |
| **Physical Print Support** | Optional secure pipeline for PDF‑to‑printer workflows. |
| **Regulatory Disclosure Panel** | Embed mandatory disclosures per jurisdiction. |
| **Audit Log & Versioning** | Record every issuance and revision in the Compliance DB. |

## 4. System Architecture

```
Executive Portal UI → Bond Printer Service → Chronobond Smart Contract
            ↑                   ↓
    Compliance Database    PDF Generation Engine
```

The portal provides a wizard for bond creation. The service validates input, submits blockchain transactions and generates certificates using HTML templates. Audit logs are stored in a Postgres database.

## 5. Smart‑Contract Highlights

```solidity
interface IChronobond {
    function mintBond(
        address to,
        uint256 faceValue,
        uint256 couponRate,
        uint256 maturityChronon,
        string calldata metadataURI
    ) external returns (uint256 bondId);
}
```

`metadataURI` points to a JSON manifest that includes series information, issue date, coupon schedule and a hash of the generated PDF for verification.

## 6. Certificate Template

Certificates display the bond title, holder details and a terms table. The footer includes a QR code linking to on‑chain metadata and digital signature blocks.

## 7. Security & Compliance

- OAuth2 with role‑based access.
- Sensitive data encrypted at rest; only hashes on‑chain.
- Immutable audit records for every action.
- Optional hardware security module (HSM) integration for physical print seals.

## 8. Implementation Roadmap

| Phase | Deliverable | ETA |
| ----- | ----------- | --- |
| 1 | API & smart contract integration | Q3 2025 |
| 2 | PDF template engine and sample certificates | Q3 2025 |
| 3 | Executive Portal integration | Q4 2025 |
| 4 | Compliance workflows and audit logging | Q4 2025 |
| 5 | Physical print support | H1 2026 |

This document serves as a starting point for development of the Bond Printer modules in this repository.
